## Description
EUnivate is a web application designed to connect users with university experts and professionals. Follow the instructions below to set up the project locally on your machine.

## Tech Stack
The developers are using the MERN stack for this project, which includes:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing data.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows for server-side scripting.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites:

Before setting up the EUnivate web app, make sure you have the following software installed:
   
    - Node.js (for running JavaScript outside the browser and managing packages)
    - npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)
    - Visual Studio Code (or any code editor of your choice)

## Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the Frontend Directory:
    - Open your terminal in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.
    - Change to the frontend directory of the project by running:
      cd frontend

2. Install Frontend Dependencies:
    - Ensure you have a package.json file in the frontend directory. This file lists all the dependencies needed for the frontend.
    - Install the dependencies by running:
      npm install

3. Run the Frontend Server:
    - Start the frontend development server using:
      npm start
    - After successful installation, the frontend should automatically open in your default web browser at http://localhost:5173. If it doesn't, you can manually open your browser and go to that URL.

## Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the Backend Directory:
    - Open a new terminal window or tab in Visual Studio Code.
    - Change to the backend directory of the project by running:
      cd backend

3. Run the Backend Server:
    - Start the backend server with the following command:
      npm run backend
    - If everything is set up correctly, the server should start without errors. You should see output similar to this in your terminal:
